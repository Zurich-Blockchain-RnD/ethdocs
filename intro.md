Welcome to Ethdocs  ðŸŽ‰
==========

Here you'll find documentation and resources for learning about all things blockchain. 

Reading up on anything related to blockchain on the internet can be daunting. A lot of overlap, mistakes, misinformation, partial 
information and more could make this task much more difficult than it should be. This is a general problem with finding information 
on the internet and our goal here is to find a flexible way to curate the most relevant information while avoiding the issues above, in such a way that anyone can easily follow along and participate as well.

## What are Ethdocs?
Weâ€™re a community and that helps you learn blockchain.
We're a open curation of resources where you can find only the content relevant for you.

Why wait!! get started now.ðŸ˜ƒ
